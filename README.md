# slang_ticket

This is a sample app to demonstrate how Slang can be used with apps

This has 2 primary activities. One to search for options of flight between two cities on a date and then sort/filter the results.

The "search" is currently integrated with Slang too. So users can click on the "Slang trigger" and say "Book tickets from Bangalore to chennai"

The primary interface code is in https://github.com/SlangLabs/slang_ticket/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/slanglabs/sampleapp/VoiceInterface.java
